# ✅ Hourly Rate Fix - Enhanced Booking System Issue Resolved

## **Issue Resolved**
The missing `hourlyRate` field in the fare estimation response for **hourly booking type** in the enhanced booking system has been fixed. The backend now includes the `hourlyRate` field in all vehicle options when `bookingType` is "hourly".

---

## **✅ What Was Fixed**

### **Backend Changes Made**
- **Enhanced Fare Service** (`src/services/enhancedFare.service.ts`)
  - Added `hourlyRate` field to vehicle options for **hourly booking type** in enhanced booking system
  - Uses `vehicleType.waitingRatePerHour` as the base hourly rate
  - Only included when `bookingType === "hourly"` and `hours > 0`

### **API Response Now Includes**

### **2. Expected Response**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "fare": {
      "vehicleOptions": [
        {
          "id": "saloon",
          "name": "Standard Saloon",
          "price": { "amount": 120.00, "currency": "GBP" },
          "hourlyRate": 30,  // ✅ This should now be present
          "capacity": { "passengers": 4, "luggage": 2 },
          "description": "Comfortable and efficient standard saloon"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### **3. Frontend Integration**
```typescript
// This should now work correctly
interface VehicleOption {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  price: { amount: number; currency: string };
  capacity: { passengers: number; luggage: number };
  description: string;
  hourlyRate?: number; // ✅ Now provided by backend
}

// In your component
{vehicle.hourlyRate ? (
  <div className="text-xs text-foreground font-medium notranslate">
    £{vehicle.hourlyRate}/hour
  </div>
) : (
  <div className="text-xs text-muted-foreground notranslate">
    £{(vehicle.price.amount / hours).toFixed(0)}/hour
  </div>
)}
```

---

## **🔍 When Hourly Rate is Included**

The `hourlyRate` field is only included when:
- ✅ `bookingType === "hourly"` (hourly booking type in enhanced booking system)
- ✅ `hours` is provided and greater than 0
- ✅ Vehicle type has a valid `waitingRatePerHour` value

For other booking types (one-way, return) in the enhanced booking system, the `hourlyRate` field will not be present.

---

## **📋 Frontend Implementation**

### **1. Update TypeScript Interface**
```typescript
interface VehicleOption {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  price: { amount: number; currency: string };
  capacity: { passengers: number; luggage: number };
  description: string;
  imageUrl?: string;
  eta?: number;
  hourlyRate?: number; // ✅ Now available for hourly bookings
}
```

### **2. Update Display Logic**
```jsx
const VehicleCard = ({ vehicle, bookingType, hours }) => {
  return (
    <div className="vehicle-card">
      <h3>{vehicle.name}</h3>
      <p>{vehicle.capacity.passengers} passengers • {vehicle.capacity.luggage} luggage</p>
      
      {/* Show hourly rate for hourly booking type */}
      {bookingType === "hourly" && vehicle.hourlyRate && (
        <div className="hourly-rate">
          <span className="rate">£{vehicle.hourlyRate}</span>
          <span className="unit">/hour</span>
        </div>
      )}
      
      <div className="total-price">
        <span className="amount">£{vehicle.price.amount}</span>
        <span className="currency">{vehicle.price.currency}</span>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### **3. Update Validation**
```typescript
const validateVehicleOption = (vehicle: VehicleOption, bookingType: string) => {
  if (bookingType === "hourly" && !vehicle.hourlyRate) {
    console.warn(`Vehicle ${vehicle.id} missing hourlyRate for hourly booking type`);
  }
  return true;
};
```

## **✅ Verification Checklist**

---

## **🚀 Ready for Frontend Implementation**

The backend fix is **100% complete**:

- ✅ **Hourly rates included** in fare estimation response

## **📞 Support**

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Check API Response**: Verify `hourlyRate` is present in the response
2. **Check Booking Type**: Ensure `bookingType === "hourly"`
